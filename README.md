# Predicting-Helpful-Amazon-Reviews
This project investigates what makes an Amazon product review “helpful” by analyzing a stratified sample of 20,000 reviews from the 2023 Amazon Reviews dataset. In today’s digital marketplace, customer reviews shape consumer trust and purchasing decisions more than advertising, making it vital to understand why some reviews stand out as helpful.
